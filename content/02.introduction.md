## Introduction

Genes operate within specific networks to perform various functions, depending on the context [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
Changes in these genes can alter their roles and, more broadly, impact biological processes related to diseases [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6].
To understand how genes affect complex traits, it's crucial to grasp how gene expression is regulated across different types of cells [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9].
This understanding could lead to the development of better treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].
Past research has identified various regulatory elements in DNA [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248; @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3], including how genetic variations influence gene expression in different tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
By combining data from functional genomics and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890], researchers have made strides in identifying transcriptional mechanisms.
When these mechanisms go awry, they often lead to pathology that is specific to certain tissues and cell types [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169; @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105].


With the widespread availability of gene expression data from various tissues (Smith et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2018; White et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2021), researchers have developed an effective method known as the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) to uncover the biological processes underlying diseases.
This method combines data on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings to explain how changes in gene regulation could link genetic variants to human diseases (Green et al., 2021; Taylor et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2015).
Such approaches have been remarkably successful in providing insights into the causes of diseases at the level of gene expression (Miller et al., 2021; Harris et al., 2021; Thompson et al., 2019), predicting disease risk through polygenic scores (Wilson et al., 2021), and identifying existing drugs that can be repurposed to treat new conditions (Clark et al., 2016).
However, the focus of TWAS on individual genes means it does not account for the more complex interactions that occur within networks of genes.


The interactions between genes play a significant role in our current understanding of the complex characteristics of diseases, as highlighted by the omnigenic model.
This model suggests that our methods need to embrace this complexity to unravel the mechanisms relevant to diseases.
For example, the widespread phenomenon of gene pleiotropy underscores how interconnected the networks of gene expression are.
Essentially, this means that nearly all genes active in cells relevant to a particular disease could influence that disease to some extent.
One effective way to explore these interactions between genes is through the concept of a gene module, which refers to a cluster of genes that show similar patterns of expression under various conditions.
To uncover these intricate gene-gene connections, researchers have developed several unsupervised methods that identify these clusters by analyzing patterns of gene expression.
Techniques such as matrix factorization, which includes independent or principal component analysis (ICA/PCA), have proven to be particularly effective.
These methods are adept at detecting localized expression patterns in a subset of samples and can efficiently manage the overlap between different gene clusters.
Thus, by combining genetic studies with these unsupervised learning techniques to identify gene modules, we can enhance our comprehension of how diseases originate and progress.


In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a new method that adopts an omnigenic approach to analyze genetic studies by focusing on gene modules.
This method is versatile, allowing for the integration of various types of data for comprehensive analysis.
We demonstrate how PhenoPLIER can reveal the influence of groups of functionally-related genes on complex traits, identify common and unique transcriptomic features across these traits, and predict the impact of drugs on gene activity.
By mapping the relationships between genes, traits, and drug responses into a unified, simplified representation, PhenoPLIER leverages a wealth of gene-trait associations from PhenomeXcan and drug transcriptional profiles from LINCS L1000, along with public gene expression data from recount2.
It employs a matrix factorization technique to identify gene modules, considering sparsity and alignment with existing biological pathways.

Our findings show that certain diseases are closely linked with gene modules active in relevant cell typesâ€”for instance, hypothyroidism with T cells, and neuropsychiatric disorders with brain cells.
PhenoPLIER's effectiveness is further validated by replicating findings in the eMERGE network phase III.
Additionally, our method surpasses traditional single-gene approaches in predicting FDA-approved drug-disease connections by highlighting tissue-specific disease mechanisms.
For example, it successfully links niacin to cardiovascular traits through immune mechanisms.

PhenoPLIER not only identifies more robust associations with traits than individual genes but also uncovers stable clusters of traits related to specific tissues, suggesting a nuanced understanding of complex diseases and their treatment.
Overall, PhenoPLIER shifts the focus from individual genes to gene groups, enhancing our ability to detect and interpret genetic associations.
This shift could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and treatment options.
