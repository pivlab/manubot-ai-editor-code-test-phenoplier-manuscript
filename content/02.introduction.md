## Introduction

Genes work together in specific networks to carry out various functions.
Changes in these genes can alter their function and, on a broader scale, impact biological processes relevant to disease.
Understanding how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different cell types, which can lead to improved treatments.
Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements, including genetic effects on gene expression in different tissues.
By integrating functional genomics data with GWAS data, researchers have improved the identification of transcriptional mechanisms that, when disrupted, often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.


With the abundance of gene expression data available across various tissues, a useful method for identifying biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS).
TWAS combines expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for GWAS findings.
This approach examines whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the connection between genetic variations and human diseases.
These methods have proven successful in not only elucidating disease origins at the transcriptome level but also in predicting disease risk (polygenic scores) and repurposing drugs.
Nevertheless, TWAS operates at the individual gene level and may not capture more intricate interactions at the network level.


Gene-gene interactions are essential in current theories of complex traits, such as the omnigenic model (Boyle et al., 2017), which emphasizes the need for methods to account for this complexity in unraveling disease mechanisms.
The widespread gene pleiotropy highlights the intricate interconnectedness of transcriptional networks (Watanabe et al., 2019; Finucane et al., 2015), suggesting that nearly all genes expressed in disease-relevant cell types have some impact on the trait (Boyle et al., 2017; Skene and Grant, 2019).
One approach to understanding these interactions is through gene modules, which are groups of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008; Oldham et al., 2008; Zhang and Horvath, 2005).
Several unsupervised methods have been proposed to uncover these gene-gene connections by identifying gene modules based on co-expression patterns (Eisen et al., 1998; Langfelder and Horvath, 2012; Tamayo et al., 1999).
Matrix factorization techniques, such as independent component analysis (ICA) or principal component analysis (PCA), have demonstrated superior performance in capturing local expression effects and managing module overlap effectively (Hafemeister and Satija, 2019).
Therefore, integrating genetic studies with gene modules identified through unsupervised learning could enhance our understanding of disease etiology (Oldham et al., 2015) and progression (Rhodes et al., 2004).


In this paper titled 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms,' we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic method that offers a gene module viewpoint for genetic studies.
Our approach is versatile, allowing the integration of various data types into a unified representation for comprehensive analysis.
Through the module perspective, we can deduce how clusters of functionally-related genes impact complex traits, identify shared and unique transcriptomic characteristics among traits, and predict the effects of pharmacological interventions on gene activity.
PhenoPLIER aligns gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses within a shared latent representation.
To achieve this, we merge numerous gene-trait associations (via TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and drug transcriptional profiles (from LINCS L1000) into a low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data from tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2).
We employ a matrix factorization technique to define a latent representation that extracts gene modules while adhering to sparsity constraints and preferences for pathways based on prior knowledge.
By mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we find significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
For instance, hypothyroidism correlates with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays with specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with various brain cell types.
We also observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan replicate in the eMERGE network phase III.
Additionally, we conduct a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, revealing stronger trait associations with modules than individual genes, even when known lipid metabolism genes do not reach genome-wide significance.
Compared to single-gene approaches, our module-based method better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease connections by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked to drug mechanisms (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via an immune mechanism).
This enhanced drug-disease prediction suggests that modules offer a more effective way to explore drug-disease relationships than individual genes.
Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space uncovers stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch linking lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
In conclusion, PhenoPLIER moves beyond individual genes to encompass groups of genes working together to perform various functions in specific cell types.
This approach enhances the robustness of identifying and interpreting genetic associations, prioritizing alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are absent.
This method signifies a shift in interpreting genetic studies, offering mechanistic insights to improve the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic approaches.
