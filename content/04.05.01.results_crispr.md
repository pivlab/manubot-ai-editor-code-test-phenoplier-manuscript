### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

The first experiment aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets within a disease-relevant LV.
Initially, we used a fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas9 approach in the HepG2 cell line to pinpoint 462 genes linked to lipid regulation.
Among these, we identified two high-confidence gene sets: one that decreased lipids, consisting of eight genes (*BLCAP*, *FBXW7*, *INSIG2*, *PCYT2*, *PTEN*, *SOX9*, *TCF7L2*, *UBE2J2*), and another that increased lipids, composed of six genes (*ACACA*, *DGAT2*, *HILPDA*, *MBTPS1*, *SCAP*, *SRPR*) (Supplementary Data 2).

The top 40 genes in LV246 are shown, sorted by their LV weight (matrix $\mathbf{Z}$), from largest (the top gene *SCD*) to smallest (*FAR2*);
*DGAT2* and *ACACA*, in boldface, are two of the six high-confidence genes in the lipids-increasing gene set from the CRISPR screen.
Cardiovascular-related traits are in boldface.

We analyzed 987 Latent Variables (LVs) using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) and identified 15 LVs with nominal enrichment (unadjusted *P* < 0.01) for lipid-altering gene-sets.
Among these, LV246, the top LV associated with the lipids-increasing gene-set, exhibited gene expression mainly in adipose tissue, crucial for lipid metabolism regulation.
Our regression analysis across all traits in PhenomeXcan revealed that gene weights for LV246 were predictive of gene associations for plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease.
These associations were replicated across 309 traits in eMERGE, with LV246 significantly linked to hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, and disorders of lipoid metabolism.


Two high-confidence genes identified in our CRISPR screening, *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, encode enzymes for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis and were among the most influential genes in LV246 (Figure 1b).
However, unlike other genes in LV246, *DGAT2* and *ACACA* were not associated with cardiovascular traits, unlike *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR*.
This discrepancy may be explained by the omnigenic model.
If the TWAS models for *DGAT2* and *ACACA* capture all common *cis*-eQTLs, these genes may be considered "core" genes directly affecting the trait, while others in LV246 may be "peripheral" genes that regulate them indirectly.
