## Discussion

In this study, we have developed an innovative computational method that combines statistical findings from Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) with clusters of genes, known as gene modules, that show similar patterns of expression in identical types of cells.
Our primary innovation lies in mapping gene-trait connections through a newly created model that encompasses not just data from normal tissue but also from cells exposed to various conditions and at different stages of development.
This method enhances our understanding by moving past mere statistical links to shed light on the specific cell types involved in complex diseases.
Our technique is capable of pinpointing cell types that are significant in diseases based solely on summary data, and we have successfully validated several disease-related gene modules in the eMERGE network.
Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screening technique to study the regulation of lipids, we discovered that our method, which focuses on gene modules, is effective in identifying genes that play a causal role in diseases, even in cases where individual gene associations are not apparent.
We analyze these results through the lens of the omnigenic model, which differentiates between "core" genes that directly influence a trait without affecting other genes, and "peripheral" genes.
This suggests that our approach is adept at pinpointing genes that have a direct impact on diseases, thereby highlighting new and potentially more effective targets for treatment.


In our study, we adopted a novel approach by examining gene modules, which enabled us to incorporate data on how drugs affect gene expression.
This method facilitated a better understanding of the relationships among various diseases, drugs, and specific types of cells.
Our findings demonstrate that our approach, focusing on latent variable (LV)-based drug repurposing, was more effective than traditional gene-based strategies in identifying potential connections between 322 drugs and 53 different diseases.
Moreover, our research went beyond mere statistical analysis.
By examining cardiovascular diseases and focusing on the drug niacin as a case study, we illustrated how our method can link disease processes to known drug action mechanisms, including effects on fat cells, immune cells, and cells in the ovaries known as granulosa cells.
This LV-based strategy shows promise for generating new hypotheses about how drugs work or might cause side effects, whether those drugs are already in use or still in the experimental phase.


In our study, we explored how analyzing gene expression patterns through a method known as latent representation analysis can help group diseases and traits.
This method showed that certain diseases and traits share common or unique gene expression mechanisms in tissues closely related to the diseases.
Our approach of clustering diseases allowed us to identify key latent variables (LVs) that were particularly informative for distinguishing between these groups.
Interestingly, we found that some of these LVs were closely linked to traits and diseases, with a few aligning with well-known biological pathways.
However, others, such as LV57, did not align with known pathways, suggesting they might represent new mechanisms relevant to disease.

We also discovered that certain LVs were associated with specific cell types, hinting at the precise cell types that could be causally involved in a disease.
For instance, some LVs were primarily expressed in specific tissues like adipose tissue or the ovary, while others were found across multiple tissues, indicating their role in pathways that span several complex diseases.
For example, LV136, which is linked to cardiovascular disease and corneal biomechanics, is found in a variety of cells including fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes.
Similarly, LV844 is expressed in blood and is associated with autoimmune diseases, and LV57, found in T cells, is linked to autoimmune diseases and venous thromboembolism.

These findings suggest a concept known as "network pleiotropy," where the same cell types may influence multiple related traits.
Our approach of projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, combining different datasets, is a novel method that simplifies the identification of cell types and pathways influencing complex diseases.
This technique is not only innovative but also computationally straightforward to apply.


In our study, we also explored how clustering trees, originally developed to study development in single-cell datasets, can be used to categorize diseases at various levels of detail based on underlying genetic connections.
We applied techniques that assign each disease to a single group, considering the genetic overlap across all gene modules when determining how closely two diseases are related.
However, it's important to acknowledge that two complex diseases might share only a handful of biological pathways rather than exhibit broad similarities.
Another key point is that our analysis incorporated a wide range of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with varying sample sizes and quality.
Despite efforts to mitigate the impact of this diversity in our data before analyzing disease clusters, it's challenging to completely eliminate bias in data preparation steps.
Previous research has shown that analyzing related diseases together can be more effective in uncovering common genetic roots [@doi:10.1038/ng.3985; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0121-0], and clustering trees offer a novel approach to investigate these connections through hidden genetic factors.


In our study, we introduced a novel framework based on latent variable (LV) regression to explore the connection between groups of genes (gene modules) and specific traits, utilizing a technique known as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS).
We employed a comprehensive dataset called PhenomeXcan, covering four thousand traits, to identify these connections.
Our findings revealed a substantial number of significant associations between gene modules and traits: specifically, we observed 3,450 significant associations involving 686 gene modules and 1,176 traits.
To validate our findings, we also analyzed data from the eMERGE network, where we identified 196 significant associations, highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Our analysis was not exhaustive; we concentrated on a select number of disease categories, though we have made the full range of associations across various disease areas available for further investigation in our online repository.
It's worth mentioning a potential limitation in our regression method related to how it approximates the correlations between genes.
While this approximation is generally accurate, it could potentially lead to incorrect associations if the correlation within a gene module is not precisely represented.
However, our tests on actual data suggest that our model is reliably calibrated, showing no significant signs of error in its predictions.

For those interested in delving deeper into the specifics of our methodology or exploring the complete set of associations we uncovered, we encourage visiting our GitHub repository for comprehensive details and data.


In our study, we build on the idea that groups of genes working together are likely to have linked roles in disease processes.
We combined two main methods in our research.
The first method, called MultiPLIER, helps us understand complex data by identifying hidden patterns that could relate to actual biological processes or technical issues known as "batch effects." We adapted a model from a project named recount2 for this purpose.
Although initially aimed at studying rare diseases, this model might not be perfectly suited for the broad spectrum of complex diseases we're exploring.
One limitation is that it focuses on simple patterns of gene activity, potentially overlooking more intricate relationships.
Moreover, more extensive and updated datasets have emerged since recount2 was introduced.
Despite these challenges, our approach is flexible, allowing us to potentially switch to other methods like GenomicSuperSignature if needed.

The second method we employed is known as TWAS, which investigates how genetic variations linked to diseases affect gene activity.
However, it doesn't account for other ways diseases can manifest, such as mutations that alter how proteins interact.
TWAS also has its pitfalls, including the risk of identifying false leads.
Similar to genetic studies that find groups of related genetic variations, TWAS can point to multiple genes in the same area, which might be due to various factors like shared genetic variations affecting gene activity or genes being naturally co-expressed.
Despite these complexities, our approach effectively considers the relationships between genes, enhancing our analysis.

In summary, our study combines these two innovative methods to delve into how genes contribute to diseases and potentially uncover new avenues for treatment, despite facing certain limitations inherent to each method.


Our study's results align with previous research, which has found that drugs backed by genetic evidence are more likely to advance successfully through the drug development process (Do et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016).
In our research, we discovered that using latent variables to project association results led to a more effective identification of disease-treatment pairs compared to simply analyzing the effects of individual genes.
An added advantage of our approach is that the latent variables, which drive our predictions, represent genetic features that are interpretable.
This allows for the exploration of potential mechanisms of action.
Our method was applied to prioritize drugs for diseases with diverse tissue origins.
However, one challenge we faced was choosing the most suitable tissue model from transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to detect reversed transcriptome patterns between genes and the effects induced by drugs.

The effectiveness of our method heavily relies on the quality of the data representations used.
In this study, we utilized a representation that was created by analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data.
The use of detailed datasets that examine the effects of various substances on cells (known as perturbagens) and the profiling of individual cells in tissues at different stages of development, both with and without these substances, offers a promising way to create higher quality and more easily understood data representations.
Furthermore, the ability to understand these representations is significantly enhanced by properly labeling the data with detailed information about the samples, known as metadata annotation.
Recent advancements in methods for inferring and labeling data with structured metadata are encouraging and can be applied to already existing datasets (Smith et al., 2021).
These advancements in data quality and annotation are paving the way for the broader application of methods that use latent variable projections to unravel the genetic underpinnings of complex human traits.
Our approach, by offering a new lens through which to view the mechanistic links between statistical associations found in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), enables the generation of hypotheses that can be experimentally tested.
This is particularly relevant for the functional analysis of complex diseases following genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a field that is expected to gain significant attention in the near future.
