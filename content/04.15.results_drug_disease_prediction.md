### LVs predict drug-disease pairs better than single genes

We evaluated the ability of substituting latent variables (LVs) for individual genes to predict known treatment-disease relationships using transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations from LINCS L1000.
These responses were processed and mapped to DrugBank IDs.
By matching reversed transcriptome patterns between genes and drug-induced perturbations, we prioritized drug candidates using imputed transcriptomes from TWAS.
A drug-disease score was computed by calculating the negative dot product between $z$-scores for diseases (from TWAS) and drugs (from LINCS) across different gene sets.
A high score indicated that the drug down-regulated disease-associated genes, suggesting a potential treatment.
We also projected drug expression profiles into our latent representation to estimate how pharmacological perturbations affected gene module activity.
Prediction performance was evaluated using a gold standard set of drug-disease medical indications for 322 drugs across 53 diseases.

It is important to note that the gene-trait associations and drug-induced expression profiles projected into the latent space provide a condensed summary of the results.
Despite this simplification, the LV-based method performed better than the gene-based method, with an area under the curve of 0.632 and an average precision of 0.858 (Figure 1).
The prediction results indicate that this reduced-dimensional space captures biologically relevant patterns that connect pathophysiological processes with drug mechanisms.


We investigated the relationship between niacin and coronary artery disease (CAD) using gene expression patterns.
Niacin, a B vitamin used to treat lipid disorders, has unclear clinical benefits in preventing cardiovascular disease.
Its mechanisms of action involve inhibiting an HDL catabolism receptor in the liver and diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (DGAT2).
Our analysis showed that niacin was predicted as a therapeutic drug for CAD and atherosclerosis (AT) by both gene-based and latent variable (LV)-based approaches.
Specifically, LV246, associated with plasma lipids and high cholesterol, was crucial in predicting niacin's therapeutic effects for AT.
Additionally, LV246 was important in other cardiovascular diseases like ischaemic heart disease and high cholesterol.

Analysis of key niacin-contributing LVs in various cardiovascular diseases revealed additional mechanisms of action.
For instance, the gene *GPR109A/HCAR2* encodes a high-affinity niacin receptor in adipocytes and immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells.
Previous beliefs that niacin's antiatherogenic effects were solely due to adipose tissue lipolysis inhibition have been challenged.
Research now shows that nicotinic acid can independently reduce atherosclerosis progression by activating *GPR109A* in immune cells, promoting anti-inflammatory processes.
Additionally, flushing, a common niacin side effect, is triggered by *GPR109A* activation in Langerhans cells.
The association between niacin and immune responses can be inferred from the expression of top-contributing modules, like LV116 and LV931, which show a strong immune cell signature in diseases like diarrhea, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and viral infections.
These modules, along with LV246, were among the top contributors to niacin prediction in various cardiovascular traits.

In addition to cardiovascular traits, other LVs may provide insight into the mechanisms of niacin.
For instance, LV66, a top LV impacted by niacin (Figure 1), showed predominant expression in ovarian granulosa cells.
Recent studies have suggested niacin as a potential therapy for ovarian diseases, as it has been shown to stimulate follicle growth and prevent granulosa cell apoptosis in animal models (References 1, 2).
