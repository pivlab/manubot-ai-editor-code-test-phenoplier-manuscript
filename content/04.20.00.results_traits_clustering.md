### LVs reveal trait clusters with shared transcriptomic properties

**Cluster analysis on traits using the latent gene expression representation.**
**a)** The projection of TWAS results on 3,752 traits into the latent gene expression representation is the input data to the clustering process.
A linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP) dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to the input data, and five different clustering algorithms processed all data versions.
These algorithms derive partitions from the data using different parameters (such as the number of clusters), leading to an ensemble of 4,428 partitions.
Then, a distance matrix is derived by counting how many times a pair of traits was grouped in different clusters across the ensemble.
Finally, a consensus function is applied to the distance matrix to generate consolidated partitions with different numbers of clusters (from 2 to $\sqrt{n}\approx$ 60).
These final solutions were represented in the clustering tree (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
**b)** The clusters found by the consensus function were used as labels to train a decision tree classifier on the original input data, which detects the LVs that better differentiate groups of traits.

Gene-trait associations were projected into a latent space to identify clusters with similar transcriptional processes.
To address biases in individual clustering algorithms, we developed a consensus clustering framework that combines trait partitions from different methods.
This approach, recommended for biological data analysis, involved generating diverse data versions processed with varying parameters.
A consensus function then consolidated these solutions, outperforming individual ensemble members.
Our pipeline produced 15 final consensus clustering solutions, with cluster numbers ranging from 5 to 29.
Instead of selecting a specific solution, we utilized a clustering tree to identify stable trait groups across various resolutions.
To determine the distinguishing latent variables, a decision tree classifier was trained on the input data using the identified clusters as labels.

**Clustering tree using multiple resolutions for clusters of traits.**
Each row represents a partition/grouping of the traits, and each circle is a cluster from that partition.
The number of clusters goes from 5 to 29.
Arrows indicate how traits in one cluster move across clusters from different partitions.
Most of the clusters are preserved across different resolutions, showing highly stable solutions even with independent runs of the clustering algorithm.

Phenotypes were grouped into five branches based on the clustering analysis.
The first branch, labeled as "large," encompassed most traits and subdivided only at $k$=16, including asthma, subjective well-being traits, and nutrient intake clusters.
The second branch included heel bone-densitometry measurements, while the third branch consisted of hematological assays on red blood cells, physical measures such as spirometry and body impedance, and anthropometric traits with fat-free and fat mass measures in separate sub-branches.
The fourth branch, labeled as "complex," comprised keratometry measurements, assays on white blood cells and platelets, skin and hair color traits, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, along with other cardiovascular-related traits like hand-grip strength and environmental/behavioral factors such as physical activity and diet.
Results within these branches were stable, with the same traits often clustered together across different resolutions.
Arrows between clusters indicated traits moving from one group to another, primarily within the "complex" branch and between clusters from the "large" branch to the "complex" branch.
This behavior was expected due to the shared genetic and environmental factors associated with complex diseases, making them challenging to categorize into a single cluster.

**Cluster-specific and general transcriptional processes associated with different diseases.**
The plot shows a submatrix of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ for the main trait clusters at $k$=29, considering only LVs (rows) that are well-aligned with at least one pathway.

We identified the key latent variables (LVs) driving clusters of traits by training decision tree classifiers on the input data using each cluster at $k$=29 as labels.
This analysis is shown in Figure 1 at the bottom of the clustering tree.
The top LVs that were most discriminative for each cluster were determined through this process.
Some of these LVs aligned well with known pathways, as depicted in Figure 2, while others were not previously associated with known pathways but were expressed in relevant tissues, as shown in Figure 3. 

In Figure 2, it is evident that certain LVs were specific to particular traits, while others were linked to a broad range of phenotypes, potentially indicating involvement in general biological functions.
Using our regression framework, we assessed the significant associations of these LVs with various traits.
For instance, LVs like LV928 and LV30, which aligned with early progenitors of the erythrocytes lineage, were predominantly expressed in early differentiation stages of erythropoiesis.
These LVs were strongly associated with assays on red blood cells (FDR < 0.05).
On the other hand, LV730, which is expressed in thrombocytes from different cancer samples, and LV598, expressed in corneal endothelial cells, were highly specific and associated with hematological assays on platelets and keratometry measurements, respectively.
Detailed information on these associations can be found in Tables 1, 2, and 3.


The autoimmune and cardiovascular disease sub-branches converged at $k=10$ as shown in Figure 1, indicating potential shared genetic factors.
LV57, predominantly expressed in T cells (Figure 2 and Table 1), showed strong associations with autoimmune disorders in PhenomeXcan (Table 2) and replicated associations with hypothyroidism in eMERGE (Table 3).
Additionally, LV57 was also associated with deep venous thrombosis.
In contrast, LV844 exhibited more autoimmune-specific associations with diseases like polymyalgia rheumatica, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease in PhenomeXcan (Table 4), although these associations were not replicated in eMERGE.
LV844 showed broad expression across various cell types, including blood, breast organoids, myeloma cells, lung fibroblasts, and brain cell types (Figure 3 and Table 5).


The cardiovascular sub-branch showed 129 significant LV-trait associations in PhenomeXcan and 23 in eMERGE.
LV136, related to collagen formation and muscle contraction pathways, was associated with coronary artery disease and keratometry measurements in PhenomeXcan.
In eMERGE, LV136 was linked to coronary atherosclerosis.
This LV was expressed in various cell types, including fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, pancreatic stellate cells, cardiomyocytes, and adipocytes.
Within the cardiovascular sub-branch, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders like Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and ADHD were found to be associated.
These disorders share risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and smoking.
Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with LV21 in PhenomeXcan, which was strongly expressed in soft tissue sarcomas, monocytes/macrophages, and aortic valves.
LV21 was also associated with lipids and high cholesterol in PhenomeXcan and hyperlipidemia in eMERGE.
Macrophages play a crucial role in reverse cholesterol transport and atherogenesis, while lipid metabolism in microglia is important in neurodegenerative diseases.
