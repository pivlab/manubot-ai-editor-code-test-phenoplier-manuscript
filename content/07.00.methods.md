## Methods {#sec:methods}

PhenoPLIER is a framework that combines different computational approaches to integrate gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses with groups of functionally-related genes (referred to as gene modules or latent variables/LVs).
Gene-trait associations are computed using the PrediXcan family of methods, whereas latent variables are inferred by the MultiPLIER models applied on large gene expression compendia.
PhenoPLIER provides:

1) A regression model to compute an LV-trait association,
2) A consensus clustering approach applied to the latent space to learn shared and distinct transcriptomic properties between traits, and
3) An interpretable, LV-based drug repurposing framework.

The details of these methods are provided below.

$$
\text{Equation (1)}: LV_{trait} = \beta_{trait} \cdot LV
$$

Where:
- $LV_{trait}$ represents the latent variable-trait association,
- $LV$ represents the latent variable, and
- $\beta_{trait}$ represents the regression coefficient for the trait.

$$
\text{Equation (2)}: LV_{trait} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \beta_{i} \cdot x_{i}
$$

Where:
- $LV_{trait}$ represents the latent variable-trait association,
- $n$ represents the number of genes,
- $\beta_{i}$ represents the regression coefficient for gene $i$, and
- $x_{i}$ represents the gene expression level for gene $i$.


### The PrediXcan family of methods for gene-based associations {#sec:methods:predixcan}

We used Summary-PrediXcan (S-PrediXcan) (Barbeira et al., 2018) and Summary-MultiXcan (S-MultiXcan) (Barbeira et al., 2019) as the gene-based statistical approaches, which belong to the PrediXcan family of methods (Barbeira et al., 2019).
We broadly refer to these approaches as TWAS (transcription-wide association studies).
S-PrediXcan, the summary-based version of PrediXcan, computes the univariate association between a trait and a gene's predicted expression in a single tissue.
In contrast, S-MultiXcan, the summary-based version of MultiXcan, computes the joint association between a gene's predicted expression in all tissues and a trait.
S-PrediXcan and S-MultiXcan only need GWAS summary statistics instead of individual-level genotype and phenotype data.

$$ S-PrediXcan: \text{Univariate association between a trait and a gene's predicted expression in a single tissue} $$

$$ S-MultiXcan: \text{Joint association between a gene's predicted expression in all tissues and a trait} $$

Here we briefly provide the details about the Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later (see the referenced articles for more information).
In the following, we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary); 

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}
$$ {#eq1}

is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to one.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the condensed version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$.
The significance of the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
PrediXcan requires individual-level data for model fitting, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the equation:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
Genotype variances and covariances in these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression increases or decreases disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (explained below).

S-MultiXcan is the summary version of MultiXcan, a more powerful tool than PrediXcan for detecting gene-trait associations, although it does not provide the direction of effects.
The main output of MultiXcan is the $p$-value obtained with an F-test in the multiple tissue model:

$$
\begin{split}
\mathbf{y} & = \sum_{l=1}^{p} \mathbf{t}_l g_l + \mathbf{e} \\
& = \mathbf{T} \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{e},
\end{split}
$$

where $\mathbf{T}$ is a matrix with $p$ columns $\mathbf{t}_l$, $\hat{g}_l$ is the estimated effect size for the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$ (and thus $\hat{\mathbf{g}}$ is a vector with $p$ estimated effect sizes $\hat{g}_l$), and $\mathbf{e}$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{e}^{2}$.
To address collinearity issues due to high correlation between predicted expression values for a gene across different tissues, MultiXcan uses the principal components (PCs) of $\mathbf{T}.
S-MultiXcan derives the joint regression estimates (effect sizes and their variances) in Equation (@eq:multixcan) using the marginal estimates from S-PrediXcan in Equation (@eq:spredixcan).
Under the null hypothesis of no association, $\hat{\mathbf{g}}^{\top} \frac{\mathbf{T}^{\top}\mathbf{T}}{\sigma_{e}^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{g}} \sim \chi_{p}^{2}$.
Therefore, the significance of the association in S-MultiXcan is estimated with:

$$
\begin{split}
\frac{\hat{\mathbf{g}}^{\top} (\mathbf{T}^{\top}\mathbf{T}) \hat{\mathbf{g}}}{\sigma_{e}^{2}} & \approx \bm{\hat{\gamma}}^{\top} \frac{\sqrt{n-1}}{\sigma_{\epsilon}} \left(\frac{\mathbf{T}^{\top} \mathbf{T}}{n-1}\right)^{-1} \frac{\sqrt{n-1}}{\sigma_{\epsilon}} \bm{\hat{\gamma}} \\
& = \hat{\mathbf{z}}^{\top} Cor(\mathbf{T})^{-1} \hat{\mathbf{z}},
\end{split}
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ is a vector with $p$ $z$-scores for each tissue available for the gene, and $Cor(\mathbf{T})$ is the autocorrelation matrix of $\mathbf{T}$.
Since $\mathbf{T}^{\top}\mathbf{T}$ is singular for many genes, S-MultiXcan computes the pseudo-inverse $Cor(\mathbf{T})^{+}$ using the $k$ top PCs.
Thus, $\hat{\mathbf{z}}^{\top} Cor(\mathbf{T})^{+} \hat{\mathbf{z}} \sim \chi_k^2$.
To arrive at this expression, S-MultiXcan uses the conservative approximation $\sigma_{e}^{2} \approx \sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$, where the variance of the error terms in the joint regression is approximately equal to the residual variance of the marginal regressions.
$Cor(\mathbf{T})$ is estimated using a global genotype covariance matrix, while marginal $\hat{z}_l$ in Equation (@eq:spredixcan) are approximated using tissue-specific genotype covariances.
Although S-MultiXcan yields highly concordant estimates compared with MultiXcan, results are not perfectly correlated across genes.
These differences are important for our LV-based regression model when computing the gene-gene correlation matrix.
We used S-MultiXcan results for our LV-based regression model and our cluster analyses of traits.


### TWAS resources {#sec:methods:twas}

We used two large TWAS resources from different cohorts for discovery and replication, all obtained from European ancestries.
PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083], our discovery cohort, provides results on 4,091 traits across different categories.
Supplementary Data 1 has all the details about the included GWAS, sample size and disease/trait categories.
In PhenomeXcan, these publicly available GWAS summary statistics were used to compute
1) gene-based associations with the PrediXcan family of methods (described before), and
2) a posterior probability of colocalization between GWAS loci and *cis*-eQTL with fastENLOC [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.11.012].
We refer to the matrix of $z$-scores from S-PrediXcan (Equation (@eq:spredixcan)) across $q$ traits and $m$ genes in tissue $t$ as $\mathbf{M}^{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times m}$.
As explained later, matrices $\mathbf{M}^{t}$ were used in our LV-based drug repurposing framework since they provide direction of effects.
The S-MultiXcan results (22,515 gene associations across 4,091 traits) were used in our LV-based regression framework and our cluster analyses of traits.
For the cluster analyses, we used the $p$-values converted to $z$-scores: $\mathbf{M}=\Phi^{-1}(1 - p/2)$, where $\Phi^{-1}$ is the probit function.
Higher $z$-scores correspond to stronger associations.

Our discovery cohort was eMERGE [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72], where the same TWAS methods were run on 309 phecodes [@doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] across different categories (more information about traits are available in [@doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]).
We used these results to replicate the associations found with our LV-based regression framework in PhenomeXcan.


### MultiPLIER and Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER) {#sec:methods:multiplier}

MultiPLIER [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] extracts patterns of co-expressed genes from recount2 [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838], a large gene expression dataset.
The approach applies the pathway-level information extractor method (PLIER) [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1], which performs unsupervised learning using prior knowledge (canonical pathways) to reduce technical noise.
PLIER uses a matrix factorization approach that deconvolutes gene expression data into a set of latent variables (LV), where each LV represents a gene module.
The MultiPLIER models reduced the dimensionality in recount2 to 987 LVs. 

$$
\text{LV} = \text{Latent Variables}
$$

Given a gene expression dataset $\mathbf{Y}^{m \times c}$ with $m$ genes and $c$ experimental conditions and a prior knowledge matrix $\mathbf{C} \in \{0,1\}^{m \times p}$ for $p$ MSigDB pathways (so that $\mathbf{C}_{ij} = 1$ if gene $i$ belongs to pathway $j$), PLIER finds $\mathbf{U}$, $\mathbf{Z}$, and $\mathbf{B}$ minimizing

$$
||\mathbf{Y} - \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{B}||^{2}_{F} + \lambda_1 ||\mathbf{Z} - \mathbf{C}\mathbf{U}||^{2}_{F} + \lambda_2 ||\mathbf{B}||^{2}_{F} + \lambda_3 ||\mathbf{U}||_{L^1}
$$ {#eq:met:plier_func}

subject to $\mathbf{U}>0, \mathbf{Z}>0$; $\mathbf{Z}^{m \times l}$ are the gene loadings with $l$ latent variables, $\mathbf{B}^{l \times c}$ is the latent space for $c$ conditions, $\mathbf{U}^{p \times l}$ specifies which of the $p$ prior-information pathways in $\mathbf{C}$ are represented for each latent variable, and $\lambda_i$ are different regularization parameters used in the training step.
$\mathbf{Z}$ is a low-dimensional representation of the gene space where each latent variable aligns as much as possible to prior knowledge, and it might represent either a known or novel gene module (i.e., a meaningful biological pattern) or noise.

For our drug repurposing and cluster analyses, we utilized a model to project gene-trait associations (obtained from Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies, TWAS) and gene-drug associations (obtained from Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures, LINCS L1000) into a low-dimensional gene module space.
Specifically, TWAS associations $\mathbf{M}$ (derived from either S-PrediXcan or S-MultiXcan) were projected using the following equation:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{M}} = (\mathbf{Z}^{\top} \mathbf{Z} + \lambda_{2} \mathbf{I})^{-1} \mathbf{Z}^{\top} \mathbf{M},
$$ {#eq:proj}

Here, $\hat{\mathbf{M}}^{l \times q}$ represents a matrix where traits are depicted by gene modules rather than individual genes.
Later on, we applied the same methodology to project drug-induced transcriptional profiles from LINCS L1000, enabling us to characterize drugs using gene modules.


### Regression model for LV-trait associations {#sec:methods:reg}

We adapted the gene-set analysis framework from MAGMA [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004219] to TWAS.
We used a competitive test to predict gene-trait associations from TWAS using gene weights from an LV, testing whether top-weighted genes for an LV are more strongly associated with the phenotype than other genes with relatively small or zero weights.
Thus, we fit the model

$$
\mathbf{m}=\beta_{0} + \mathbf{s} \beta_{s} + \sum_{i} \mathbf{x}_{i} \beta_{i} + \bm{\epsilon},
$$ {#eq:reg:model}

where $$ \mathbf{m} $$ is a vector of S-MultiXcan gene $p$-values for a trait (with a $-log_{10}$ transformation); $$ \mathbf{s} $$ is a binary indicator vector with $$ s_{\ell}=1 $$ for the top 1% of genes with the largest loadings for LV $$ \ell $$ (from $$ \mathbf{Z}_{\ell} $$) and zero otherwise; $$ \mathbf{x}_{i} $$ is a gene property used as a covariate; $$ \beta $$ are effect sizes (with $$ \beta_{0} $$ as the intercept); and $$ \bm{\epsilon} \sim \mathrm{MVN}(0, \sigma^{2} \mathbf{R}) $$ is a vector of error terms with a multivariate normal distribution (MVN) where $$ \mathbf{R} $$ is the matrix of gene correlations.

The model tests the null hypothesis $\beta_{s} = 0$ against the one-sided hypothesis $\beta_{s} > 0$.
Therefore, $\beta_{s}$ reflects the difference in trait associations between genes that are part of latent variable (LV) $\ell$ and genes outside of it.
Following the MultiXcan Analysis of Gene-Mapping Associations (MAGMA) framework, we used two gene properties as covariates: 

$$
\begin{align*}
1) & \text{Gene size}, \text{defined as the number of Principal Components (PCs) retained in S-MultiXcan}, \\
2) & \text{Gene density}, \text{defined as the ratio of the number of PCs to the number of tissues available}.
\end{align*}
$$

These covariates were included to account for potential confounding factors in the analysis.

Since the error terms $\bm{\epsilon}$ could be correlated, we cannot assume they have independent normal distributions as in a standard linear regression model.
In the PrediXcan family of methods, the predicted expression of a pair of genes could be correlated if they share eQTLs or if they are in LD (Gamazon et al., 2019).
Therefore, we used a generalized least squares approach to account for these correlations.
The gene-gene correlation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ was approximated by computing the correlations between the model sum of squares (SSM) for each pair of genes under the null hypothesis of no association.
These correlations are derived from the individual-level MultiXcan model (Equation (1)), where the predicted expression matrix $\mathbf{T}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p_i}$ of a gene $i$ across $p_i$ tissues is projected into its top $k_i$ principal components (PCs), resulting in matrix $\mathbf{P}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k_i}$.
From the MAGMA framework, we know that the SSM for each gene is proportional to $\mathbf{y}^{\top} \mathbf{P}_{i} \mathbf{P}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{y}$.
Under the null hypothesis of no association, the covariances between the SSM of genes $i$ and $j$ are therefore given by $2 \times \mathrm{Trace}(\mathbf{P}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{P}_{j} \mathbf{P}_{j}^{\top} \mathbf{P}_{i})$.
The standard deviations of each SSM are given by $\sqrt{2 \times k_{i}} \times (n - 1)$.
Therefore, the correlation between the SSMs for genes $i$ and $j$ can be written as follows:

$$
\begin{split}
\mathbf{R}_{ij} & = \frac{2 \times \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{P}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{P}_{j} \mathbf{P}_{j}^{\top} \mathbf{P}_{i})}{\sqrt{2 \times k_{i}} \times \sqrt{2 \times k_{j}} \times (n - 1)^2} \\
& = \frac{2 \times \mathrm{Tr}(Cor(\mathbf{P}_{i}, \mathbf{P}_{j}) \times Cor(\mathbf{P}_{j}, \mathbf{P}_{i}))}{\sqrt{2 \times k_{i}} \times \sqrt{2 \times k_{j}}},
\end{split}
$$

where columns $\mathbf{P}$ are standardized, $\mathrm{Tr}$ is the trace of a matrix, and the cross-correlation matrix between PCs $Cor(\mathbf{P}_{i}, \mathbf{P}_{j})$ is given by:

$$
\begin{split}
Cor(\mathbf{P}_{i}, \mathbf{P}_{j}) & = Cor(\mathbf{T}_{i} \mathbf{V}_{i}^{\top} \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_i)^{-1/2}, \mathbf{T}_{j} \mathbf{V}_{j}^{\top} \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_j)^{-1/2}) \\
& = \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_i)^{-1/2} \mathbf{V}_{i} \left(\frac{\mathbf{T}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{T}_{j}}{n-1}\right) \mathbf{V}_{j}^{\top} \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_j)^{-1/2},
\end{split}
$$

where $\frac{\mathbf{T}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{T}_{j}}{n-1}$ is the cross-correlation matrix between the predicted expression levels of genes $i$ and $j$, and columns of $\mathbf{V}_{i}$ and scalars $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\mathbf{T}_{i}$, respectively.
S-MultiXcan keeps only the top eigenvectors using a condition number threshold of $\frac{\max(\lambda_i)}{\lambda_i} < 30$.
To estimate the correlation of predicted expression levels for genes $i$ in tissue $k$ and gene $j$ in tissue $l$, $(\mathbf{t}_k^i, \mathbf{t}_l^j)$ ($\mathbf{t}_k^i$ is the $k$th column of $\mathbf{T}_{i}$), we used (Gusev et al., 2019):

$$
\begin{split}
\frac{(\mathbf{T}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{T}_{j})_{kl}}{n-1} & = Cor(\mathbf{t}_k^i, \mathbf{t}_l^j) \\
& = \frac{ Cov(\mathbf{t}_k, \mathbf{t}_l) } { \sqrt{\widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_k) \widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_l)} } \\
& = \frac{ Cov\left(\sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_k} w_a^k X_a, \sum_{b \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_b^l X_b\right) }  {\sqrt{\widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_k) \widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_l)} } \\
& = \frac{ \sum_{\substack{a \in \mathrm{model}_k \\ b \in \mathrm{model}_l}} w_a^k w_b^l Cov(X_a, X_b)} {\sqrt{\widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_k) \widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_l)} } \\
& = \frac{ \sum_{\substack{a \in \mathrm{model}_k \\ b \in \mathrm{model}_l}} w_a^k w_b^l \Gamma_{ab}} {\sqrt{\widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_k) \widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_l)} },
\end{split}
$$

where $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$, $w_a^k$ is the weight of SNP $a$ for gene expression prediction in the tissue model $k$, and $\Gamma = \widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{X}) = (\mathbf{X} - \bar{\mathbf{X}})^{\top} (\mathbf{X} - \bar{\mathbf{X}}) / (n-1)$ is the genotype covariance matrix using GTEx v8 as the reference panel, which is the same used in all TWAS methods described here.
The variance of the predicted expression values of gene $i$ in tissue $k$ is estimated as (Zeng et al., 2018):

$$
\begin{split}
\widehat{\mathrm{var}}(\mathbf{t}_k^i) & = (\mathbf{W}^k)^\top \Gamma^k \mathbf{W}^k \\
& = \sum_{\substack{a \in \mathrm{model}_k \\ b \in \mathrm{model}_k}} w_a^k w_b^k \Gamma_{ab}^k.
\end{split}
$$

Since we utilized the MultiXcan regression model (Equation ($$ \ref{eq:multixcan} $$)), matrix $\mathbf{R}$ serves as an approximation of gene correlations in S-MultiXcan.
As previously discussed, S-MultiXcan estimates the joint regression parameters in MultiXcan by utilizing the marginal regression estimates from S-PrediXcan in Equation ($$ \ref{eq:spredixcan} $$) with certain simplifying assumptions and distinct genotype covariance matrices.
This complexity hinders the development of an S-MultiXcan-specific solution for computing matrix $\mathbf{R}$.
To address this issue, we focused on a submatrix $\mathbf{R}_{\ell}$ that pertains solely to genes within latent variable (LV) $\ell$ (specifically the top 1% of genes) rather than the entire matrix $\mathbf{R$.
This simplification is considered conservative as it only considers correlations among the top genes.
Our supplementary simulations (Supplementary Note 1) demonstrate that the model is adequately calibrated and capable of correcting for LVs containing closely related genes at the top (e.g., Figure \ref{fig:reg:nulls:qqplot:lv234}).
Additionally, the simulations identified 127 LVs where the model was not well-calibrated (e.g., Figure \ref{fig:reg:nulls:qqplot:lv914}).
This discrepancy can be attributed to challenges in accurately computing a gene correlation matrix, leading us to exclude these LVs from our primary analyses.

In Equation ($$ \ref{eq:reg:corr_genes} $$), for each gene, we only considered tissue models present in S-PrediXcan results, as well as SNPs present in GWAS used as input for the TWAS approaches.
This is necessary to obtain more accurate correlation estimates [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889].
Therefore, we computed different correlation matrices for PhenomeXcan and eMERGE.

In PhenomeXcan, most of the GWAS (4,049) were obtained from the UK Biobank using the same pipeline and including the same set of SNPs, so a single correlation matrix was used for this set.
For the rest, we used a single correlation matrix for each group of traits that shared the same or most of the SNPs.

We ran our regression model for all 987 LVs across the 4,091 traits in PhenomeXcan.
For replication, we ran the model in the 309 phecodes in eMERGE.
We adjusted the $p$-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.


### LV-based drug repurposing approach {#sec:methods:drug}

For the drug-disease prediction, we developed an LV-based method using a drug repositioning framework that was previously applied to psychiatry traits (Smith et al., 2018), where individual genes associated with a trait are anticorrelated with expression profiles for drugs.
To evaluate the performance of our LV-based method, we compared it with a previously published single-gene approach.
In the single-gene method, we calculated a drug-disease score by multiplying each set of signed z-scores from S-PrediXcan in tissue t, $\mathbf{M}^t$, with another set of signed z-scores from transcriptional responses profiled in LINCS L1000 (Dudley et al., 2017), $\mathbf{L}^{c \times m}$ (for c compounds).
Here, $\mathbf{M}^t$ indicates whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with disease risk, while $\mathbf{L}$ indicates whether a drug increases or decreases the expression of a gene.
These two matrices can be multiplied to compute a score for a drug-disease pair.
The resulting product is:

$$
\mathbf{D}^{t,k}=-1 \cdot \mathbf{M}^{t,k} \mathbf{L}^\top
$$

where k represents the number of most significant gene associations in $\mathbf{M}^t$ for each trait.
As proposed in Smith et al.
(2018), k could include all genes or the top 50, 100, 250, and 500; then, we averaged score ranks across all k to obtain $\mathbf{D}^t$.
Finally, for each drug-disease pair, we selected the maximum prediction score across all tissues:

$$
\mathbf{D}_{ij} = \max \{ \mathbf{D}_{ij}^t \mid \forall t \}
$$


The same procedure was utilized for the LV-based approach, in which we projected $\mathbf{M}^{t}$ and $\mathbf{L}$ into the gene module latent space using Equation (@eq:proj).
This led to the formation of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}^t$ and $\hat{\mathbf{L}}^{l \times c}$, respectively.
Finally, we calculated $\mathbf{D}^{t,k}=-1 \cdot \hat{\mathbf{L}}^{\top} \hat{\mathbf{M}}^{t,k}$, where in this scenario, $k$ could represent all LVs or the top 5, 10, 25, and 50 (given that we have an order of magnitude fewer LVs than genes). 

$$
\text{Equation (@eq:proj)}: \hat{\mathbf{M}}^t = \mathbf{M}^{t} \mathbf{W}^{t}, \hat{\mathbf{L}} = \mathbf{L} \mathbf{W}^{l}


Since the gold standard of drug-disease medical indications is described with Disease Ontology IDs (DOID) [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky1032], we mapped PhenomeXcan traits to the Experimental Factor Ontology [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq099] using [@url:https://github.com/EBISPOT/EFO-UKB-mappings], and then to DOID.


### Consensus clustering of traits {#sec:methods:clustering}

We performed two preprocessing steps on the S-MultiXcan results before the cluster analysis.
First, we combined results in $\mathbf{M}$ (with $p$-values converted to $z$-scores, as described before) for traits that mapped to the same Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq099] term using the Stouffer's method:

$$
\sum w_i M_{ij} / \sqrt{\sum w_i^2}
$$

Here, $w_i$ represents a weight based on the GWAS sample size for trait $i$, and $M_{ij}$ is the $z$-score for gene $j$.
Second, we divided all $z$-scores for each trait $i$ by their sum to reduce the effect of highly polygenic traits:

$$
M_{ij} / \sum M_{ij}
$$

Finally, we projected this data matrix using Equation (@eq:proj), obtaining $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ with $n$=3,752 traits and $l$=987 LVs as the input of our clustering pipeline.


A partitioning of the matrix $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ with $n$ traits into $k$ clusters is represented as a label vector $\pi \in \mathbb{N}^n$.
Consensus clustering approaches consist of two steps: 1) the generation of an ensemble $\Pi$ with $r$ partitions of the dataset: $\Pi=\{\pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots, \pi_r\}$, and 2) the combination of the ensemble into a consolidated solution defined as:

$$
\pi^* = \mathrm{arg}\,\underset{\hat{\pi}}{\max} Q(\{ \lvert \mathcal{L}^i \lvert \phi(\hat{\pi}_{\mathcal{L}^i}, \pi_{i \mathcal{L}^i}) \mid i \in \{1,\ldots,r\} \}),
$$ {#eq:consensus:obj_func}

where $\mathcal{L}^i$ is a set of data indices with known cluster labels for partition $i$, $\phi\colon \mathbb{N}^n \times \mathbb{N}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a function that measures the similarity between two partitions, and $Q$ is a measure of central tendency, such as the mean or median.
The adjusted Rand index (ARI) was used for $\phi$ and the median for $Q$.
To obtain $\pi^*$, a consensus function $\Gamma\colon \mathbb{N}^{n \times r} \to \mathbb{N}^n$ with $\Pi$ as the input is defined.
Consensus functions based on the evidence accumulation clustering (EAC) paradigm were used, where $\Pi$ is first transformed into a distance matrix $\mathbf{D}_{ij} = d_{ij} / r$, with $d_{ij}$ representing the number of times traits $i$ and $j$ were grouped in different clusters across all $r$ partitions in $\Pi$.
Then, $\Gamma$ can be any similarity-based clustering algorithm applied on $\mathbf{D}$ to derive the final partition $\pi^*$.


For the ensemble generation step, we utilized various algorithms to create a highly diverse set of partitions (see Figure 1) since diversity is a crucial aspect for ensembles (Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014).
We employed three data representations: the raw dataset, its projection into the top 50 principal components, and the embedding learned by UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018) using 50 components.
For each of these, we applied five clustering algorithms covering a wide range of different assumptions on the data structure: k-means (Arthur & Vassilvitskii, 2007), spectral clustering (Ng et al., 2001), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996). 

$$
k: \text{number of clusters}
$$

$$
\epsilon: \text{maximum distance between two data points}
$$

$$
\text{minPts}: \text{minimum number of data points in a neighborhood}

For k-means, spectral clustering, and GMM, we specified a range of k between 2 and √n ≈ 60, and for each k, we generated five partitions using random seeds.
For hierarchical clustering, for each k, we generated four partitions using common linkage criteria: ward, complete, average, and single.
For DBSCAN, we combined different ranges for parameters ε and minPts based on the procedure by Zhang et al.
(2018).
Specifically, we used minPts values from 2 to 125.
For each data representation (raw, PCA, and UMAP), we determined a plausible range of ε values by observing the distribution of the mean distance of the minPts-nearest neighbors across all data points.
Since some combinations of minPts and ε might not produce a meaningful partition, we resampled partitions generated by DBSCAN to ensure an equal representation of this algorithm in the ensemble.
This procedure resulted in a final ensemble of 4,428 partitions of 3,752 traits.


Finally, we used spectral clustering on matrix $\mathbf{D}$ to derive the final consensus partitions.
Matrix $\mathbf{D}$ was first transformed into a similarity matrix by applying a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel $\mathrm{exp}(-\gamma \mathbf{D}^2)$ using four different values for $\gamma$ that were empirically determined to work best.
Therefore, for each value of $k$ between 2 and 60, we derived four consensus partitions and selected the one that maximized Equation (1).
We further filtered this set of 59 solutions to keep only those with an ensemble agreement larger than the 75th percentile (Figure 1), leaving a total of 15 final consensus partitions as shown in Figure 2. 

$$
\mathrm{exp}(-\gamma \mathbf{D}^2) \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
$$

The input data in our clustering pipeline undergoes several linear and nonlinear transformations, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and the ensemble transformation using the Ensemble Agglomerative Clustering (EAC) paradigm (distance matrix $\mathbf{D}$).
Although consensus clustering has clear advantages for biological data (Jiang et al., 2016), this set of data transformations complicates the interpretation of results.
To circumvent this, we used a supervised learning approach to detect which gene modules/Latent Variables (LVs) are the most important for each cluster of traits (Figure 1b).
Note that we did not use this supervised model for prediction but only to learn which features (LVs) were most discriminative for each cluster.

For this, we used the highest resolution partition ($k$=29, although any could be used) to train a decision tree model using each of the clusters as labels and the projected data $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ as the training samples.
For each $k$, we built a set of binary labels with the current cluster's traits as the positive class and the rest of the traits as the negative class.
Then, we selected the LV in the root node of the trained model only if its threshold was positive and larger than one standard deviation.
Next, we removed this LV from $\hat{\mathbf{M}$ (regardless of being previously selected or not) and trained the model again.
We repeated this procedure 20 times to extract the top 20 LVs that better discriminate traits in a cluster from the rest.

In [Supplementary Note 2](#sm:clustering:null_sim), we performed several analyses under a null hypothesis of no structure in the data to verify that the clustering results detected by this pipeline were real.


### CRISPR-Cas9 screening {#sec:methods:crispr}

**Cell culture.** HepG2 cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC® HB-8065™) and maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium with L-Glutamine (EMEM, Cat.
112-018-101, Quality Biology) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco, Cat.16000-044) and 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco, Cat.15140-122).
The cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidity-controlled environment with 5% CO2 and were kept at a density not exceeding 80% confluency in Collagen-I coated flasks.

$$

&\text{Where:} \\
&\text{EMEM} = \text{Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium} \\

Maintaining the cells in these conditions ensured their viability and

**Genome-wide lentiviral pooled CRISPR-Cas9 library.** The 3rd generation lentiviral library, known as the Broad GPP genome-wide Human Brunello CRISPR knockout Pooled library, was generously provided by David Root and John Doench from Addgene (Cat.
73179-LV).
This library was utilized for transducing HepG2 cells.
It comprises 76,441 sgRNAs, targeting 19,114 genes in the human genome, with an average of 4 sgRNAs per gene.
Each 20 nucleotide sgRNA cassette was inserted into the lentiCRIS-PRv2 backbone between the U6 promoter and gRNA scaffold.
The lentiviral vectors encoding Cas9 were employed to deliver the sgRNA cassette-containing plasmids into cells during replication.
Cells that were not successfully transduced were eliminated through puromycin selection.

**Lentiviral titer determination.** 

No-spin lentiviral transduction was utilized for the screen.
In a Collagen-I coated 6-well plate, approximately 2.5 million cells were seeded in each well in the presence of 8 µg/ml polybrene (Millipore Sigma, Cat.
TR-1003 G), and a different titrated virus volume (e.g., 0, 50, 100, 200, 250, and 400 µl) was assigned to each well.
EMEM complete media was added to make the final volume 1.24 ml. 

16-18 hours post-transduction, virus/polybrene-containing media was removed from each well.
Cells were washed twice with 1x DPBS and replaced with fresh EMEM.
At 24 hours, cells in each well were trypsinized, diluted (e.g., 1:10), and seeded in pairs of wells of 6-well plates. 

At 60 hours post-transduction, cell media in each well was replaced with fresh EMEM.
2 µg/ml of puromycin (Gibco, Cat.
A1113803) was added to one well out of the pair.
2-5 days after puromycin selection, or the 0 virus well treated with puromycin had no survival of cells, cells in both wells with/without puromycin were collected and counted for viability.
Percentage of Infection (PI%) was obtained by comparing the cell numbers with/without puromycin selection within each pair. 

By means of Poisson's distribution theory, when transduction efficiency (PI%) is between 30-50%, which corresponds to a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of ~0.35-0.70.
At an MOI close to 0.3, around 25% of cells are infected, and the majority of those infected cells are predicted to have only one copy of the virus.
Therefore, a volume of virus (120 µl) yielding 30-40% of transduction efficiency was chosen for further large-scale viral transduction.

**Lentiviral Transduction in HepG2 Using Brunello CRISPR Knockout Pooled Library.** To ensure a coverage of at least 500 cells per single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and maintain a multiplicity of infection (MOI) between 0.3-0.4, which guarantees that 95% of infected cells receive only one viral particle per cell, approximately 200 million cells were used for the screen.
The transduction process followed a similar protocol as previously outlined.
Specifically, 2.5 million cells were seeded in each well of 14 6-well plates, supplemented with 8 μg/ml of polybrene.
Subsequently, 120 μl of the virus was added to each experimental well.
Eighteen hours after transduction, the virus/polybrene mix was removed, and cells from each well were harvested, quantified, and combined into T175 flasks.
At 60 hours post-transduction, 2 μg/ml of puromycin was introduced to each flask.
The medium was refreshed every two days with fresh Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) containing 2 μg/ml puromycin.
Seven days after puromycin selection, the cells were gathered, pooled, quantified, and replated.

$$ MOI = \frac{Viral \ particles}{Cells} {#id} $$

$$ Coverage = \frac{Total \ cells}{Total \ sgRNAs} {#id} $$

**Fluorescent dye staining.** Nine days after puromycin selection, cells were divided into two groups.
Twenty to thirty million cells were collected as the Unsorted Control.
The cell pellet was centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
The dry pellet was stored at -80°C for subsequent genomic DNA isolation.
The remaining cells (approximately 200 million) were cultured in 100 mm dishes and stained with a fluorescent dye (LipidSpotTM 488, Biotium, Cat.
70065-T).
In brief, LipidSpot 488 was diluted to 1:100 with DPBS.
Four milliliters of the staining solution were added to each dish and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes.
Cell images were captured using a fluorescent microscope EVOS for GFP signal detection (Figure 1). 

$$

$$

**Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).** Cells were immediately collected into 50 mL tubes (from this point on, keep cells cold) and spun at 500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
After DPBS wash, cell pellets were resuspended with FACS Sorting Buffer (1x DPBS without Ca2+/Mg2+, 2.5 mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES, 1% BSA).
The solution was filter sterilized and kept at 4°C, with gentle pipetting to ensure single cells.
The cell solution was then filtered through a cell strainer (Falcon, Cat.
352235) and kept on ice, protected from light.
Collected cells were sorted on FACSJazz using a 100 µm nozzle for sorting.
Approximately 20% of each GFP-High and GFP-Low population (Figure 2) was collected into 15 mL tubes.
After sorting, cells were immediately spun down, and the pellets were kept at -80°C for further genomic DNA isolation.

**Genomic DNA isolation and verification.** Three conditions of Genomic DNA (Un-Sorted Control, lentiV2 GFP-High, and lentiV2 GFP-Low) were extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat.51104), followed by UV Spectroscopy (Nanodrop) to assess the quality and quantity of the gDNA.
A total of 80-160 µg of gDNA was isolated for each condition.
The sgRNA cassette and lentiviral specific transgene in isolated gDNA were verified through PCR (Figure 3).

$$
\text{Figure 3: PCR verification of sgRNA cassette and lentiviral specific transgene in isolated gDNA.}
$$

**Illumina libraries generation and sequencing.** The fragment containing the sgRNA cassette was amplified using P5/P7 primers, as indicated in the study by Xie et al.
(2016), and primer sequences were adapted from the Broad Institute protocol (Figure 1).
Stagger sequence (0-8 nt) was included in P5 and an 8 bp uniquely barcoded sequence in P7.
Primers were synthesized through Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), and each primer was PAGE purified.
32 PCR reactions were set up for each condition.
Each 100 μl PCR reaction consisted of roughly 5 μg of gDNA, 5 μl of each 10 μM P5 and P7.
ExTaq DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa, Cat.
RR001A) was used to amplify the amplicon.
The PCR Thermal Cycler Parameters were set as follows: Initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min; followed by 24 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 52.5°C for 30 seconds, extension at 72°C for 30 seconds.
A final elongation at 72°C for 10 minutes.
PCR products of 285-293 bp were expected (Figure 2A).
PCR products within the same condition were pooled and purified using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat.
B23318).
Purified Illumina libraries were quantitated on Qubit, and the quality of the library was analyzed on a Bioanalyzer using a High Sensitivity DNA Chip.
A single approximate 285 bp peak was expected (Figure 2B).
Final Illumina library samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000.
Samples were pooled and loaded on an SP flow cell, along with a 20% PhiX control v3 library spike-in.
