## Abstract {.page_break_before}

How do genes interact to influence complex traits and what role do gene-gene interactions play in disease development and progression? We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.
This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
