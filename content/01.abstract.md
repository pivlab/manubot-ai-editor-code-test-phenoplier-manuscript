## Abstract {.page_break_before}

How do genes interact to influence complex traits and disease mechanisms, and how can this knowledge be leveraged for therapeutic development? This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological data to analyze gene expression patterns across different conditions.
By identifying modules of co-expressed genes associated with diseases and drug mechanisms, PhenoPLIER can accurately predict drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
Through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes within trait-associated modules.
This approach highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.
