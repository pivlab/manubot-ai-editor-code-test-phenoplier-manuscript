## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Genes work together in specific contexts to fulfill their functions, and understanding their collective influence on complex traits necessitates a detailed insight into how gene expression is regulated under varying conditions.
This knowledge is essential for the development of new therapeutic strategies.
While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that interactions between genes are critical to the development and progression of diseases.
In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis.
This framework identifies clusters of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under the same conditions.
We demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene clusters expressed in relevant cell types.
PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates drug mechanisms of action.
Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct associations but are crucial in trait-associated clusters.
By leveraging the collective behavior of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool to uncover genetic associations and identify potential therapeutic targets that single-gene approaches might overlook.
